# bots
Welcome to the generic bot platform

Please make sure you install the requirements.txt
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

The android phone manager (screeshot, video streaming etc ) is under Application managers


I broke things down into "cards" this just was some prototyping I was doing to simplify chaining events (for a larger overall project,)
The pokemon go bot came out as a side product, i've made a vew other ones.

just treat them as classes.

the sending gifts program is under CardPrototyping/card_SendGifts

it's a very easy run:

on the phone order friends by can receive
go on the first profile

execute the class SendGifts from the same path as the class. (not sure if path configs are fine)

make sure your phone is connected via cable and you have adb installed
