# bots
Welcome to the generic bot platform

Please make sure you install the requirements.txt
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

The android phone manager (screeshot, video streaming etc ) is under Application managers


I broke things down into "cards" this just was some prototyping I was doing to simplify chaining events (for a larger overall project,)
The pokemon go bot came out as a side product, i've made a vew other ones.

just treat them as classes.

the sending gifts program is in playground.py (it uses CardPrototyping/card_SendGrifts module

it's a very easy run:

on the phone order friends by can receive
go on the first profile

execute the file playground.py from root

make sure your phone is connected via cable and you have adb installed

there are many tools available in img_tools and throughout this project, feel free to explore document improove.
i've made a tool to train images easily (with tensorflow) and save models/reload them when needed
have some sample code for that as well somewhere, but this is mainly a fun place to explore and build bots.
