The android phone manager (screeshot, video streaming etc ) is under Application managers


I broke things down into "cards" this just was some prototyping I was doing to simplify chaining events, 
just treat them as classes.

the sending gifts card is under CardPrototyping/card_SendGifts

it's a very easy run:

on the phone order friends by can receive
go on the first profile

execute the class SendGifts from the same path as the class. (not sure if path configs are fine)

make sure your phone is connected via cable and you have adb installed
